# malli - plain data schemas

## Rationale
- Schemas as immutable data
  - can be transported over the line
  - saved to database
  - combined freely
- Does not depend on global registry
- Programmable, on the runtime as well

Should have:
- Context dependent pluggable validators
- Context dependent pluggable coercers
- Close compatibility to Json Schema 7

Could have:
- Clojure spec generation
- Database schema generations
